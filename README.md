> <u>*Always I am AFK,not available to code for something fun and fix some bugs:p*</u>

Hi~This is MoYoez,a student studying CS for ~~life~~ fun,currently I do fix bugs and write some plugins for Bot running with Zerobot.

Hopeful and Thankful to this code space,coding or write something funny or useable maybe a good choice to kill my time.

I hope I can become a Full Stacks Developer in the next few years.

> always try to be kind,and not to be rude all the time,maybe I desired to meet more people and learn more.:D
